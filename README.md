For the fourth project of the Grow With Google Developer Scholarship Program (and, conjointly, Udacityâ€™s Android Development Nanodegree program), students were asked to build and design a recipe app (written in Java) that delivers step-by-step baking lessons to the end user. This app also has a home screen widget for easy access to instructions for the current recipe.

This project called for using Exoplayer to display instructional videos parsed from a retrieved JSON object. The most challenging/rewarding learning experience with Exoplayer was figuring out how to handle unexpected inputs from recipe objects (e.g., cooking steps with no instructional videos).

<b>Esspreso and Writing Tests</b>

In prepartion for becoming a professional Android Developer, this project takes a TDD approach and incorporates idling resources to ensure that activities and UI components function as expected.

Probably the most exciting learning experience of this project was developing a partnering home widget app to provide easy access to a selected recipe's steps.

Students were asked to implement the Master-Detail Design pattern to ensure that apps offer an optimal experience across device types.
